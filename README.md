# Learn Golang

Tracking my learning progress and exercises to learn Go.

## Motivation

I want to learn Go and track everything, so I can derive a classroom
and blog articles from it.

## Description

[Go/Golang](https://golang.org/) is a programming language made for the cloud.
It is a statically typed, compiled, and garbage collected language. It is
designed to be portable and efficient.

This repository will contain my excersises and notes on Go.

### Course

My exersises will be based on
["Let's Go" from Alex Edwards](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) and
["Einführung in Go" from Andreas Schöpfer](https://www.udemy.com/course/einfuhrung-in-go/).

### Project

As my project to learn a new language, I have opted for a web application. It
is somewhat a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/index.php) clone. The idea is to
write a prototype for a new [while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io/)
application.

### Notes

Notes and documentation can be found in the [docs/](docs/) directory. These will
mostly contain links, ideas, hints, explanations and stuff that does not fit
elsewhere.

### Exercises

Excersises will gathered in the [exercises/](exercises/) directory. Each
exercise will have a small README alongside to explain whats going on and how
to start the example.
